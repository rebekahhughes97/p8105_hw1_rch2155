## Problem 1

The following code creates a data frame, labeled as “hw1\_p1\_df”, with
four variables, including a random sample that follows a normal
distribution of sample size 10, a logical vector indicating elements
greater than 0 as “true”, a character vector of length 10 and a factor
vector of length 10 and with 3 different levels.

``` r
library (tidyverse)
```

``` r
hw1_p1_df = tibble (
  rand_samp = rnorm (10, sd = 0.5),
  rand_samp_pos = rand_samp > 0,
  rand_samp_char = c("Apple", "Lemon", "Lime", "Pear", "Plum", "Peach", "Berry", "Cherry", "Mango", "Melon"),
  rand_samp_fact = factor (c("red", "yellow", "green", "yellow", "red", "red", "red", "red", "yellow", "green")))
```

The data frame created has 10 observations and 4 variables.

Below, the means of each of the 4 variables from the data frame is
computed.

``` r
rand_samp_av = mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp))
log_av = mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos))
char_av = mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_char))
fact_av = mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_fact))
```

Of the above mean calculations, only the means for the random sample and
the logical vector variables were able to be determined becasue they are
numeric.

Next, the following code converts the logical vector, character vector
and factor vector variables to numeric.

``` r
log_numeric = as.numeric (hw1_p1_df$rand_samp_pos)
char_numeric = as.numeric (hw1_p1_df$rand_samp_char)
fact_numeric =  as.numeric (hw1_p1_df$rand_samp_fact)
```

In the code above only the logical vector variable and the factor vector
variable are successfully able to be converted to numeric form. The
character vector variable is not able to be converted to numeric.
