## Problem 1

The following code creates a data frame, labeled as “hw1\_p1\_df”, with
four variables, including a random sample that follows a normal
distribution of sample size 10, a logical vector indicating elements
greater than 0 as “true”, a character vector of length 10 and a factor
vector of length 10 and with 3 different levels.

``` r
hw1_p1_df = tibble (
  rand_samp = rnorm (10),
  rand_samp_pos = rand_samp > 0,
  rand_samp_char = c("Apple", "Lemon", "Lime", "Pear", "Plum", "Peach", "Berry", "Cherry", "Mango", "Melon"),
  rand_samp_fact = factor (c("red", "yellow", "green", "yellow", "red", "red", "red", "red", "yellow", "green")))
```

The data frame created has 10 observations and 4 variables.

Below, the means of each of the 4 variables from the data frame is
computed.

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.3949507

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_fact))
```

    ## [1] NA

Of the above mean calculations, only the means for the random sample and
the logical vector variables were able to be determined becasue they are
numeric.

Next, the following code converts the logical vector, character vector
and factor vector variables to numeric.

``` r
log_numeric = as.numeric (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos))
char_numeric = as.numeric (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_char))
fact_numeric =  as.numeric (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_fact))
```

In the code above only the logical vector variable and the factor vector
variable are successfully able to be converted to numeric form. The
character vector variable is not able to be converted to numeric because
it is not applicable.

The next bit of code first converts the logical vector to numeric, as
shown by the new variable “num\_log”, and then multiples that result by
the random sample variable. Second, the logical vector is converted to a
factor, as shown by the variable “fact\_log”, and is then again
multiplied by the random sample variable. Third, the logical vector is
converted to a factor, as shown by the variable “fact2\_log”, then is
converted to numeric, as shown by the variable “num\_fact\_log”, and
then is ultimately multiplied by the random sample variable.

``` r
num_log = as.numeric (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos)) * pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp)
fact_log = as.factor (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos)) * pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp)
fact2_log = as.factor (pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp_pos))
num_fact_log = as.numeric (fact2_log) * pull (hw1_p1_df, rand_samp)
```

The first code line that converts the logical vector to numeric is able
to be multiplied by the random sample variable and comes out with a
numeric answer. The second code line that converts the logical vector to
a factor is not able to be multiplied by the random sample variable
because the factor is not numeric. The third code line combined with the
fourth code line together correct the problem from the second code line
and are able to be multiplied by the random sample variable
successfully.

## Problem 2

The following code retrieves the data set “penguins” to be used in this
problem:

``` r
data ("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The different categorical variables in the data set and their values
are: species, including Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap species; island,
including Torgersen, Biscoe and Dream islands; sex, divided into male
and female; and year, including 2007, 2008 and 2009. Since there is not
data available for at least one of the penguins for all of the
quantitative variables, the missing variable has to be removed from the
mean calculations. The mean of bill length is 43.9219298 mm with a
standard deviation of 5.4595837 mm. The mean of bill depth is 17.1511696
mm with a standard deviation of 1.9747932 mm. The mean body mass is
4201.754386 g with a standard deviation of 801.9545357 g. The mean
flipper length is 200.9152047 mm with a standard deviation of 14.0617137
mm. The penguins data set includes 8 columns and 344 rows.

The following code builds a scatterplot of the penguins data set with
Bill Length on the x-axis and Flipper Length on the y-axis and the color
depending on species.

``` r
ggplot (penguins, aes (x = bill_length_mm,
                       y = flipper_length_mm,
                       color = species)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_rch2155_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

As displayed in the scatterplot, the species cluster around each other
with Gentoo having the largest flipper length and a large bill length,
Chinstrap having a small flipper length and a large bill lenth and
Adelie having the smallest flipper length and bill length.

The following code saves the above plot of the “penguins” data set to
the project directory:

``` r
ggsave ("penguins.pdf")
```
